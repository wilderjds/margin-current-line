;; margin-current-line is a package to indicate current line on the margin.
;; You can use by the following steps.

;;
;; 2. Add the following code into your init file:
;;
;;   (require 'margin-current-line)
;;
;; 3. Activate the mode.
;;
;; * To enable it only in certain buffer, run `M-x margin-current-line-mode'.
;;   Run again and you can disable it.
;;
;; * To enable it globally, add the following into your init file:
;;
;;     (global-margin-current-line-mode 1)
;;
;;   You can toggle it by running `M-x global-margin-current-line-mode'.
